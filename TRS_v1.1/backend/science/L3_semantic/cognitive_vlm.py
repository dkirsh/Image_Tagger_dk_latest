Cognitive / affective analyzer driven by a Visual Language Model.

WARNING: All outputs from this module are L3 HYPOTHESES.
They depend on VLM inference and should be treated as provisional
until validated against ground truth.

The analyzer asks a VLM to rate the scene on:
- Five core environmental-psychology dimensions (Kaplan & Kaplan + restoration)
- Five affective / experiential dimensions (cozy, welcoming, tranquil, scary, jarring)

Ported to L3_semantic with add_hypothesis() API.
